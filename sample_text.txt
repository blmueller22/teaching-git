Hello,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen and I live in Germany. My hobbies include going to discos and sometimes listening to music on the radio. In the summer I go swimming in a lake. I haven't any brothers or sisters. We take busses to school. I visit year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday. I hope I will become a new guitar.
When I am grown up I want to be a scientist, especially a geophysicist.

Yours,
Fritz Cola
